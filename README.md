How does it work?

Thanks to the terminal you can create a post for your site.

For the correct operation of this project you need:
1. Create a database mongodb
2. Insert the path to its location (it can be a link to the cloud version or local).
3. Create a collection: posts
4. Done

To work, you need to run index.js(server) and createPost.ts
For your convenience, I recommend using Bun as the runtime to open createPost.ts because index.js(server) does not support bun only node

This project is easily scalable and looks very unusual.
Maybe you will find a more interesting use for it :)
