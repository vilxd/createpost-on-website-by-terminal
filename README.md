How it works?

Thanks to the terminal, you can create a post for your website.

For the correct operation of this project is required:
1. Create a database mongodb
2. Insert the path to its location (it can be a link to the cloud version or local).
3. Create a collection: posts
4. Done

To work you need to run index.js(server) and createPost.ts
For your convenience, I recommend Bun as a runtime.

This project is easily scalable and looks very unusual.
Maybe you will find more interesting use for it :)
